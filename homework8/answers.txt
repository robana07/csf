Collaboration:

Had help for some problem from jbirdd1

Reflection:

It was interesting homework. I learnt how to make a graph and connect them. It was somewhat difficult as I did more problems, so much so that I had to get help from people, and I still didn't finish it. Some of the questions required were confusing and the timebox made me stop there.

(Don't forget to complete the time survey!)
